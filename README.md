Cross-course project, «Rainydays»

The purpose of this project was answer the assignments given as part of several courses trough the first year of my Front-End studies at Noroff, fall 2022-spring 2023.
The brief said to chose one of three prompts to first deign and later build a webpage. I chose the Rainydays option, a website for a outdoors clothing company. The site is for online shopping and for potential customers to get to know the company.  


Description

This website was made over the course of two semesters, across several courses. As I have been introduced to new course and skills, so has the site evolved. The courses the have included this project are: Design 1, Web and Communications Technology, HTML and CSS, Interaction Design, Content Management System.

I first started it while working on the design course at the very start of my studies. 

It was later built with HTML and CSS as the course assignment of the HTML and CSS course. At this point I also made some changes based on user feedback. 

Later the site was further improved upon when some changes were made as part of the Interaction design course. ???

The latest addition was keeping the products in a Wordpress API, using Local. Because the API source is made locally, the products does not show up on the live site.

The site is made up of 7 pages:
- A front page
- A contact page
- An about page
- A page listing products, here jackets
- A page specific to whatever jacket the user selects
- A checkout page
- And a checkout success page

The website is built to be responsive, and look good and thereby be user-friendly on different devices.

The design of the website is simple, mainly light grey and a dark green, inspired by a misty forest. Some of the content was provided with the assignment, like the images of the jackets, the name of the company, and its logo. Some of the images I got from Unsplash. The text is mainly lorem ipsum.


Built With

The site was first all hard coded using only HTML and CSS. The products list page and the specific product page was later rebuilt using a Wordpress API and JavaScript. The Wordpress API was created using Local. 
For the contents of the product posts, some of the content was provided with the assignment, and some of the images I got from Unsplash. The text is mainly lorem ipsum. 
I worked in vsCode when building the project, and used GitHub to keep up with changes and versions. 
The site is deployed to Netlify, but the contents kept in the Wordpress API can only be accessed with the export zip from Local.


Getting Started
Installing and Running

The site can be viewed as a user, by using Netlily. However the contents kept in the Wordpress API can only be accessed with the export zip from Local.
